This repo contains the base code for the mobile game we built at HackNTU 2016. It is an image-recognition based RPG game that allows users to capture images of real-life objects that they will be able to convert into virtual useful items for their characters. We used cloud Azure services which gave us the technology for image recognition on portable devices. Among over 200+ international teams, we ultimately won the Top 2 Prize in Game Category (less than 15 teams received prizes) and 50,000 NTD in total.
